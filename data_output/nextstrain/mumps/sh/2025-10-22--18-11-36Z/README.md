## Scope of this dataset

Based on the SH gene region (~315nt), this dataset assigns genotypes (e.g. A to N) to Mumps samples based on [criteria outlined by the WHO](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/241922/WER8722_217-224.PDF) and tree placement.

Strains picked from a combination of the following papers:

* Jin et al 2005 - https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-005-0563-4
* Jin et al 2015 - https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.1819
* WHO 2012 - https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/241922/WER8722_217-224.PDF

There is a "Mumps MuV Genotypes (genome)" Nextclade dataset based on the full genome region available at `nextstrain/mumps/genome`
