This dataset allows users to assign Ebola virus (EBOV) sequences to known EBOV outbreaks for which high-quality genomes are available.
Ebola virus was formerly known as Ebola virus Zaire, but has been [renamed as Ebola virus (EBOV) in the genus Orthoebolavirus by ICTV](https://ictv.global/report/chapter/filoviridae/filoviridae/orthoebolavirus).


## Data provenance and Acknowledgements

The reference tree in this dataset sources data from Pathoplexus and includes RESTRICTED sequences.
These sequences were generously shared pre-publication by the authors to aid public health response.
It is not allowed to use these sequences in preprints or publications without permission of the authors, see [Pathoplexus data use terms](https://pathoplexus.org/about/terms-of-use/data-use-terms) for details.

This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data among research groups led by the Ministry of Public Health of DRC, Hygiene and Prevention through INRB (DRC), all technical outbreak response teams within the INSP-COUSP and health division of the affected provinces.

Data are shared via [Pathoplexus](https://pathoplexus.org), and analysis via [virological.org](https://virological.org) and Nextstrain, and will be continuously updated as new sequences are generated. If you intend to use these sequences before final publication of papers describing them, please contact Prof.~Placide Mbala-Kingebeni for request and coordination.
