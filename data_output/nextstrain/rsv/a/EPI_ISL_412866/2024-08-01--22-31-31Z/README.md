## Scope of this dataset
This dataset for RSV-B uses reference sequence A/England/397/2017 with is available at under accession number EPI_ISL_412866 in GISAID. An almost identical sequence (slightly longer, 12 mutations, no gaps or indels) is available in NCBI as [LR699737](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LR699737).
This sequence has the duplication in the G-protein shared by all currently circulating variants.
The reference tree covers the diversity of RSV-A since the first sequenced samples.


## Nomenclature
The dataset follows the consortium nomenclature established in 2023 that uses a combination of letters and numbers to designate lineages in a hierarchical fashion.
Definitions of individuals lineages are available on github in the repository [rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-A](https://github.com/rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-A).
Legacy clade definitions for the nomenclature defined by Goya et al (`G_clade`) are included for orientation. These clade definitions will not be updated and are incomplete. We encourage users to use the new consortium nomenclature.
