Addition of sublineages of B.D.E.1.7-8 and B.D.E.6-7

 - [B.D.E.1.7](https://github.com/rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-A/blob/main/lineages/B.D.E.1.7.yml)
 - [B.D.E.1.8](https://github.com/rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-A/blob/main/lineages/B.D.E.1.8.yml)
 - [B.D.E.6](https://github.com/rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-A/blob/main/lineages/B.D.E.6.yml)
 - [B.D.E.7](https://github.com/rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-A/blob/main/lineages/B.D.E.7.yml)

 - designate new lineage B.D.4.1.2 and B.D.4.1.3. The former is an older group that doesn't seem to circulating at the moment, but is added for consistency
 - designate lineages B.D.E.1.2-6: these are several recent groups defined to break up the dominant B.D.E.1 lineage
 - designate lineage B.D.E.5: this is a small group with several substitutions in the F-protein.
 - update with new sequence data
 - remove deprecated G-clades

## 2024-11-27T02:51:00Z

 - update reference tree with more recent data.
 - include designation of B.D.E.1.1

## 2024-08-01T22:31:31Z
