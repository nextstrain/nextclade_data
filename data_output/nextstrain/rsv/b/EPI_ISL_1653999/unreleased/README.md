## Scope of this dataset
This dataset for RSV-B uses reference sequence B/Australia/VIC-RCH056/2019 with is available at [OP975389](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/OP975389.1) and also deposited under accession number EPI_ISL_1653999 in GISAID. This sequence has the duplication in the G-protein shared by all currently circulating variants.
The reference tree covers the diversity of RSV-B since the first sequenced samples.


## Nomenclature
The dataset follows the consortium nomenclature established in 2023 that uses a combination of letters and numbers to designate lineages in a hierarchical fashion.
Definitions of individuals lineages are available on github in the repository [rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-B](https://github.com/rsv-lineages/lineage-designation-B).
Legacy clade definitions for the nomenclature defined by Goya et al (`G_clade`) are included for orientation. These clade definitions will not be updated and are incomplete. We encourage users to use the new consortium nomenclature.
