 - designate new lineage B.D.4.1.2 and B.D.4.1.3. The former is an older group that doesn't seem to circulating at the moment, but is added for consistency
 - designate lineages B.D.E.1.2-6: these are several recent groups defined to break up the dominant B.D.E.1 lineage
 - designate lineage B.D.E.5: this is a small group with several substitutions in the F-protein.
 - update with new sequence data
 - remove deprecated G-clades
