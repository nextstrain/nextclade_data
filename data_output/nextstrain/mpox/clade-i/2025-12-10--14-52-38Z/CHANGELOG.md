- Breaking change: outbreak nomenclature now follows the system described in [Ruis et al. (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03820-6). As a result, outbreak `hMPXV-1` is now called `sh2017`. In addition, the clade Ib outbreak is labeled as outbreak `sh2023`, and the clade Ia outbreak described in [Wawina-Bokalanga et al. (2025)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00294-6) is labeled as outbreak `sh2024`.

- Sequences released since the last update in April 2025 are now included.
- Add schema definition url to `pathogen.json`. This is a purely technical change, for convenience of dataset authors. The data itself is not modified.

- Newly released sequences are included.
- Sequences are now downloaded from Pathoplexus instead of NCBI virus. This allows inclusion of restricted-use clade I sequences from INRB (Placide Mbala-Kingebeni's group) in the DRC. This nearly doubles clade I sequences available.
- Based on user feedback, the QC rule for missing data (Ns) has been made more lenient.
- Masked ranges that are ignored for placement have been updated.
