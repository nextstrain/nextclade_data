## Scope of this dataset
This dataset uses the first highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) isolate (A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96) as a reference and is suitable for the analysis of circulating and historical H5 sequences, including low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) isolates.

## Features
This dataset supports

 * Assignment to clades and subclades based on the provisional nomenclature defined by the WHO/FAO/WOAH H5 Nomenclature Working Group
 * Sequence QC
 * Phylogenetic placement

## Clades of H5Nx avian influenza viruses

The WHO/FAO/WOAH H5 Nomenclature Working Group define "clades" as genetically divergent groups of viruses, based on their HA gene segment.
Viruses falling into a given clade share a common ancestor with significant bootstrap support and have low levels of within-clade diversity.
When significant within-clade diversity is seen, these clades can be further split into sub-clades; for example, clade `2.3.4.4` is being split into eight additional sub-clades, named `2.3.4.4a` through `2.3.4.4h` due to high circulating diversity within the clade.
This Nextclade dataset incorporates these provisional `2.3.4.4` sub-clades, as well as sub-clades `2.3.2.1a` through `2.3.2.1g` for the `2.3.2.1` split.
