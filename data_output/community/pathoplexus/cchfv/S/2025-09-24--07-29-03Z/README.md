## Features

This dataset was created using open data from NCBI Virus and the pipeline in https://github.com/neherlab/CCHFV running in no-linkage mode. As the S segment shows high divergence at the terminals we increase the gap open penalty to reduce the number of falsely inferred insertions.

Lineages are assigned using the annotation defined in **Serena A. Carroll, Brian H. Bird, Pierre E. Rollin, Stuart T. Nichol,
Ancient common ancestry of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus** (2010), [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2010.01.006).

This dataset offers:

- Phylogenetic placement
- Genome Annotation and Alignment
- QC
- Lineage Assignment
