## Scope of this dataset

This dataset uses the historical G-10 reference sequence ([U05876.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U05876)), which may differ from contemporary global CVA16 strains. It is intended for broad subgenogroup classification, mutation quality control, and phylogenetic analysis of CVA16 diversity.

## Features

This dataset supports:

- Assignment of subgenotypes
- Phylogenetic placement
- Sequence quality control (QC)

## Subgenogroups of Cocksackievirus A16

The genogroups A, B1, and B2 represent major phylogenetic divisions within CVA16, commonly used in virological surveillance and literature. These are defined by phylogenetic clustering and do not necessarily indicate antigenic differences.

No standardized global lineage system is currently maintained, so subgenogroup naming follows historical and regional convention.

## What is a Nextclade dataset?

A Nextclade dataset includes the reference sequence, gene annotations, a phylogenetic tree, and QC configuration. Learn more in the [Nextclade documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/datasets.html).
