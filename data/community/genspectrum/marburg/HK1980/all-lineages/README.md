# Nextclade dataset for "Marburg Virus" based on reference "NC_001608.3"

**Orthomarburgvirus marburgense** species taxon (taxonId: 3052505), members of this species are called marburgviruses. However, the species has two distinct lineages: ravn virus (RAVV) and marburg virus (MARV). Alignments use the official INSDC marburg virus reference sequence [NC_001608.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001608.3).

The example sequences are a subsample of 20 Orthomarburgvirus marburgense sequences with over 10% coverage.

## Scope of this dataset

## Features

This dataset was created using the pipeline in https://github.com/anna-parker/marburg-virus-tree and NCBI Virus. Lineages and clades are assigned using the paper:
**Gianguglielmo Zehender, Chiara Sorrentino, Carla Veo, Lisa Fiaschi, Sonia Gioffr√®, Erika Ebranati, Elisabetta Tanzi, Massimo Ciccozzi, Alessia Lai, Massimo Galli,

for clade names; link [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816302386?via%3Dihub). However, we choose not to show the B.1 clade as with additional samples the grouping is no longer very clear.
