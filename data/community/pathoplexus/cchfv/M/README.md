## Features

This dataset was created using open data from NCBI Virus and the pipeline in https://github.com/neherlab/CCHFV running in no-linkage mode. As the M segment shows high divergence at the terminals we increase the gap open penalty to reduce the number of falsely inferred insertions.

This dataset offers:

- Phylogenetic placement
- Genome Annotation and Alignment
- QC
