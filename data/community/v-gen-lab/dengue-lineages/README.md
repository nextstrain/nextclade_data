# Implementation of the Dengue Lineages System for Designation via NextClade

These datasets are based on the dengue virus lineage systems described by [Verity et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.16.24307504), and are suitable for the analysis of viral sequences from the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4). The systems are independent; therefore, each serotype should be analyzed in the corresponding specific dataset.
