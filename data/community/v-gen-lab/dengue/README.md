# Implementation of the Dengue Lineages System for Designation via NextClade

These datasets are based on the dengue virus lineage systems described by [Hill et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.16.24307504) and are suitable for the analysis of viral sequences from the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4). The systems are independent; therefore, each serotype should be analyzed using the corresponding specific dataset.

More information about the Dengue Lineages Project can be found on the [Dengue Lineages website](https://dengue-lineages.org/) and the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DENV-lineages).

The source code is available at [V-GEN-Lab/dengue-lineages-nextclade](https://github.com/V-GEN-Lab/dengue-lineages-nextclade).
