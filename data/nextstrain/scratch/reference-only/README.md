# Scratch dataset for alignment to custom reference

## Scope of this dataset

This dataset is a minimal example to allow users to upload their own reference sequence and align some other sequences to that reference.

To use this dataset, you _must_ upload your own reference sequence in FASTA format, through the "customize" interface.
