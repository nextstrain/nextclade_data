After discussion with various members of the seasonal influenza virus surveillance community, it was decided that subclade names starting with `H` have the potential to be confused with major influenza hemagglutinin subtypes. These subclades where therefore renamed to start with the alias `J`.

 - `H` --> `J`
 - `H.1` --> `J.1`
 - `H.2` --> `J.2`
 - `H.3` --> `J.3`
 - `H.4` --> `J.4`

The subclades `H` and `H.*` were revoked, and a comment was added to explain the reason. No subclade definitions were changed.
