## Scope of this dataset
B/Yamagata viruses have not been observed since 2020. This dataset is provided for analysis of old sequences or suspected Yamagata sequences.


## Features
This dataset supports

 * Assignment to clades
 * Identification of glycosilation motifs
 * Sequence QC
 * Phylogenetic placement

## Clades of seasonal influenza viruses

The WHO Collaborating centers define "clades" as genetic groups of viruses with signature mutations to facilitate discussion of circulating diversity of the viruses.
Clade demarcation do not always coincide with significantly different antigenic properties of the viruses.
