### What are the SARS-CoV-2 clades?

Nextclade was originally developed during COVID-19 pandemic, primarily focused on SARS-CoV-2. This section describes clades with application to SARS-CoV-2, but Nextclade can analyse other pathogens too.

Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has diversified into several different co-circulating variants. To facilitate discussion of these variants, we have grouped them into __clades__ which are defined by specific signature mutations.

We currently define more than 30 clades (see [this blog post](https://nextstrain.org/blog/2021-01-06-updated-SARS-CoV-2-clade-naming) for details):

- 19A and 19B emerged in Wuhan and have dominated the early outbreak
- 20A emerged from 19A out of dominated the European outbreak in March and has since spread globally
- 20B and 20C are large genetically distinct subclades 20A emerged in early 2020
- 20D to 20J have emerged over the summer of 2020 and include three "Variants of Concern" (VoC).
- 21A to 21F include the VoC __delta__ and several Variants of Interest (VoI).
- 21K onwards are different clades within the diverse VoC __omicron__.

Within Nextstrain, we define each clade by its combination of signature mutations. You can find the exact clade definition in [github.com/nextstrain/ncov/defaults/clades.tsv](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/defaults/clades.tsv). When available, we will include [WHO labels for VoCs and VoIs](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).
