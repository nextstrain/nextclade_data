## Scope of this dataset

This dataset is useful for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences that are descended from the BA.2.86 lineage, which emerged in mid-2023.

The reference used is Wuhan-Hu-1 but with BA.2.86 SNPs added to make it easier to interpret the results.

For the analysis of non-BA.2.86 sequences, other datasets, e.g. XBB, BA.2 or using the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference might be more appropriate.

## Features

This dataset supports:

- Assignment of Nextstrain clades
- Assignment of Pango lineages
- Sequence QC
- Phylogenetic placement
- Calculation of ACE2 binding scores relative to BA.2.86 as described in [Starr et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1010951)
