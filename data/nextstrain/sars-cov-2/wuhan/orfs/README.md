## Scope of this dataset

This dataset is useful for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the entire pandemic.

For the analysis sequences descended from BA.2, that is the majority of post-2022 sequences, the BA.2 dataset might be more appropriate. For XBB and BA.2.86, descendants, there are even more specific datasets available.

This dataset annotates amino acid mutations in ORF1a and ORF1b coordinates. If you are interested in mutations annotated on mature proteins (nsp1-16), you can use the mature protein dataset.

## Features

This dataset supports:

- Assignment of Nextstrain clades
- Assignment of Pango lineages
- Sequence QC
- Phylogenetic placement
