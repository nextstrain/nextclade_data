## Unreleased

- Sequences released since the last update in April 2025 are now included.
- Add schema definition url to `pathogen.json`. This is a purely technical change, for convenience of dataset authors. The data itself is not modified.

## 2025-04-25T12:24:24Z

- Newly released sequences are included.
- Sequences are now downloaded from Pathoplexus instead of NCBI virus. This allows inclusion of restricted-use clade I sequences from INRB (Placide Mbala-Kingebeni's group) in the DRC. This nearly doubles clade I sequences available.
- Based on user feedback, the QC rule for missing data (Ns) has been made more lenient.
- Masked ranges that are ignored for placement have been updated.
