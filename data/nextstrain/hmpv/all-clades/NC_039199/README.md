# Human Metapneumovirus

This is the [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/) build and dataset for human metapneumovirus. 

Metadata and sequences used in this repository are available via <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/taxonomy/162145>.

The building encompasses praparing data for analysis, doing quality control, performing analyses, saving the results in a format suitable for visualization (with[ auspice](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice)) and creating example sequence data. This involves running components of Nextstrain such as [augur](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur) and [nextclade](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade). The Nextclade dataset comprises the Nextclade build, a reference sequence, the dataset configurations, genome annotations as well as example sequence data. 

The Nextclade dataset can be used to identify differences between example sequence data and the reference sequence, assign sequences to clades and report potential sequence quality issues.
