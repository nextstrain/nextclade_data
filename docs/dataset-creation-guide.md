# Nextclade dataset creation guide

This guide describes how to create a new Nextclade dataset from scratch. Datasets are how Nextclade is customized to work with a particular virus.

Once a dataset is created, it can be shared with other users via the Nextclade data repository or a separate Github repository.

## Recommended prerequisites

- Knowledge of command line bioinformatics
- Basic knowledge of Nextclade, in particular of the Nextclade CLI
- Familiarity with Nextstrain's augur toolchain (not strictly necessary, but helpful)
- Ability to read a simple Snakemake workflow

## Overview

A Nextclade dataset is a collection of files. While Nextclade CLI can be used with as little as a reference sequence, a full dataset to be used with Nextclade web requires a general configuration file as well. The full set of files is as follows:

1. A reference sequence against which to align user-provided sequences (required)
1. A genome annotation for the reference sequence in GFF3 format (recommended)
1. A phylogenetic tree in Auspice JSON format (optional)
1. A general configuration file (`pathogen.json`) in JSON format (required for Nextclade Web)

The official specification of these files is available in the Nextclade docs at <https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/input-files/index.html>.

The guide here complements the specifications by going through a concrete workflow that produces these files for an example virus (Zika).

## Choosing a reference sequence

As all sequences are aligned to the reference sequence and all mutations are reported relative to it, the choice of the reference sequence is important.

A good reference sequence should be of high quality and cover the entire genome (or at least the regions of interest).

A good default choice is an NCBI refseq. For example, for Zika virus, the most recent NCBI refseq is `NC_035889.1`. It is available on GenBank at <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_012532.1>.

If all current circulation is derived from a more recent common ancestor, it may be better to use a more recent reference sequence to reduce the number of mutations reported.

See the Nextclade docs for the [full specification of the reference sequence file](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/input-files/02-reference-sequence.html).

## Preparing the genome annotation

Nextclade uses the genome annotation to determine how to extract amino acid sequences from aligned nucleotide sequences. Nextclade requires the genome annotation to be in [GFF3 format](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md). Nextclade only uses the `CDS` feature type. Each `CDS` feature is treated separately for translation, alignment and amino acid mutation reporting.

While Genbank provides annotations in GFF3 format, there is often a discrepancy between what the dataset creator wants to be translated and what is annotated as a CDS in the Genbank provided GFF3 file. In addition, users may want to change names of CDS features to make them more readable in Nextclade output.

For example, the Genbank GFF3 file for the Zika refseq has a single CDS feature for the entire polyprotein with a cryptic `Name` "YP_009428568.1". Instead, one may want to translate each mature protein separately and give them more readable names. This can be done by editing the GFF3 file by hand, or by using a custom script. By hand, we can remove the existing CDS feature and renaming all `mature_protein_region_of_CDS` feature types to `CDS`. Overlapping precursors can be removed as well, as appropriate. In addition, a `gene` attribute can be added with the name one wants to see in Nextclade. Unfold the section below to see both the original and the modified GFF3 files:

Alternatively, one can use a custom script to perform these tasks. We provide an interactive script in [`example-workflow/scripts/generate_from_genbank.py`](./example-workflow/scripts/generate_from_genbank.py) that requires an NCBI accession as input and walks the user through the process of picking the CDS features and naming them.

Further details on the genome annotation file format are available in the [Nextclade docs](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/input-files/03-genome-annotation.html).

## Preparing a minimal `pathogen.json` config file and accompanying files

A `pathogen.json` config file is required to use a dataset with Nextclade web. Luckily, it is very simple to create by hand. All that is required is the schema version, a manifest of files and their paths. In addition, it is recommended to include basic attributes for display in the UI, such as name of the virus and the reference sequence.

Lastly, one can enable basic quality control for frame shifts, stop codons, missing or ambiguous nucleotides and mutation clusters.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "3.0.0",
  "files": {
    "reference": "reference.fasta",
    "pathogenJson": "pathogen.json",
    "genomeAnnotation": "genome_annotation.gff3",
    "examples": "sequences.fasta",
    "readme": "README.md",
    "changelog": "CHANGELOG.md"
  },
  "attributes": {
    "name": "Zika virus",
    "reference name": "Zika virus strain MR 766",
    "reference accession": "NC_012532.1"
  },
  "qc": {
    "schemaVersion": "1.2.0",
    "missingData": {
      "enabled": true,
      "missingDataThreshold": 2000,
      "scoreBias": 500,
      "scoreWeight": 50
    },
    "snpClusters": {
      "enabled": true,
      "windowSize": 100,
      "clusterCutOff": 6,
      "scoreWeight": 50
    },
    "mixedSites": {
      "enabled": true,
      "mixedSitesThreshold": 15,
      "scoreWeight": 50
    },
    "frameShifts": {
      "enabled": true,
      "scoreWeight": 20
    },
    "stopCodons": {
      "enabled": true,
      "scoreWeight": 50
    }
  }
}
```

Further details on the `pathogen.json` file format are available in the [Nextclade docs](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/input-files/05-pathogen-config.html).

Adding example sequences is useful to allow users (and dataset creators) to quickly test the dataset. A README is useful to provide additional information about the dataset. Lastly, a CHANGELOG helps users understand what has changed between different versions of the dataset. As a starting point, they can be minimal:

`README.md`:

```md
# Example dataset for Zika virus

This is a minimal example dataset for demonstration purposes.
```

`CHANGELOG.md`:

```md
## Unreleased

Initial release.
```

(The heading `## Unreleased` is required for the CHANGELOG to be accepted by the Nextclade data repo).

## Testing the minimal dataset

All the files described above are contained in the [`minimal-dataset`](./minimal-dataset) directory with a flat structure:

```txt
minimal-dataset
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── README.md
├── sequences.fasta
├── genome_annotation.gff3
├── pathogen.json
└── reference.fasta
```

The easiest way to test the dataset is via the Nextclade CLI:

```sh
nextclade run \
  minimal-dataset/sequences.fasta \
  --input-dataset minimal-dataset \
  --output-all tmp
```

This runs Nextclade on the example sequences in `minimal-dataset/sequences.fasta` using the dataset in `minimal-dataset`. The results are saved to the `tmp` directory and contain alignment, aligned translations and a summary TSV file.

One can also use the dataset in Nextclade Web by hosting the dataset through a local web server. For example, after having installed `node` and run `npm install -g serve`, one can host the dataset via:

```sh
serve --cors minimal-dataset -l 3000
```

And open Nextclade Web with a URL parameter `dataset-url` pointing to the local web server:

```url
https://master.clades.nextstrain.org/?dataset-url=http://localhost:3000
```

Once the web page loads, you can click "Load example" and click run to test. You may want to reduce the maximum number of nucleotide markers to 500 to prevent Nextclade from freezing (click "Settings" at the top right, then select the "Sequence view" tab and reduce "Max. nucleotide markers to 500).

If the dataset is committed in a Github repository, one can bypass the local web server step and use a Github URL directly:

```url
https://master.clades.nextstrain.org/?dataset-url=gh:nextstrain/nextclade_data@docs-v3@/docs/minimal-dataset
```

Due to the lack of reference tree and QC configuration, there will neither be any QC information nor tree view. This will be tackled in the next section.

## Creating a reference tree

While Nextclade can be used without a reference tree, a lot of the functionality is lost. In particular, without reference tree, there is no tree view, no clade assignment and no private mutations QC.

The reference tree is a standard Nextstrain tree in Auspice JSON format, so the general Nextstrain documentation applies. Nextclade specific details are described in the [Nextclade docs](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/input-files/04-reference-tree.html).

We provide a simple Snakemake workflow in this repository at [`example-workflow`](./example-workflow) that builds a reference tree with minimal effort. The workflow can be configured to work with viruses other than Zika by changing the constants (in particular `REFERENCE_ACCESSION`, `TAXON_ID`, and `GENES`) at the top of the [Snakefile](./example-workflow/Snakefile).

You also need to provide paths to the reference sequence (in fasta and genbank formats) and the genome annotation.

The example workflow is a good starting point, but if you want to customize the it's recommended to consult Nextstrain documentation, for example the [Creating a pathogen workflow tutorial](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/tutorials/creating-a-workflow.html).

## Next steps

Once you have your dataset created and committed in a Github repository, you can share it with others through a custom URL, e.g.

```url
https://master.clades.nextstrain.org/?dataset-url=gh:nextstrain/nextclade_data@docs-v3@/docs/example-workflow/dataset
```

To make your dataset easily discoverable by all Nextclade users, you can submit it to the Nextclade data repository via a pull request. See the [dataset curation guide](dataset-curation-guide.md) for details. If you have any questions, please post them in the [Nextstrain discussion forum](https://discussion.nextstrain.org/).

## FAQs

### What to do with segmented viruses?

Each segment of a segmented virus should be treated separately and have its own dataset.

### Does Nextclade work for circular genomes?

Nextclade supports circular genomes. Genes that cross the origin are translated according to the GFF3 specifications.

### Does Nextclade support spliced genes?

Yes, Nextclade supports spliced genes. Each exon should be annotated as a separate CDS feature according to the GFF3 specifications.

### Does Nextclade support ribosomal slippage?

Yes, Nextclade supports genes with programmed ribosomal frameshifting as long as the CDS is annotated according to the GFF3 specifications.

### Must the reference sequence be at the root of the reference tree?

No, generally this is not required, however, the mutations from the reference sequence to the root of the tree must be added to the root branch of the tree. This can be achieved automatically by passing the reference sequence to the `--root-sequence` argument of [`augur ancestral`](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/usage/cli/ancestral.html).
